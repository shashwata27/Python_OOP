we think everything as an Object which is part of a class

every object have two properties i.e. attributes and behaviour

attributes(variables): what the object knows

behaviour(methods/functions): what the object does

object does something i.e behavior based on what it knows i.e attributes

in class we specify the design/blueprint the object,
 where object are representing real entities thus objects are instances of class


eg;  car class and nissan, honda be objects of it
