variables 2 types:

1.the self.variables in a class are instance variables, they change with the object(belongs to instance namespace)

2. if we define a variable inside the class and outside __init__ is becomes a static/class variable(belongs to class namespace)
 if we want to change a class variable we have change it byt calling it through the class i.e. class.variable=new value




methods 3 types:

1. Instance methods ,the methods with self in the method arrgument
    again instance metods can be 2 types: getters/accessors and setters/mutators
    get methods get the value of a attribute
    set methods set the value of a attribute

2.class methods,
 the methods with cls in the method arrgument
 and we have to use decorators before method if we dont want to pass the class again

3.static methods,
methods that interact with neither instances(self) nor the class(cls) are static() methods
